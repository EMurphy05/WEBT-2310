    <ul class="cases">
        <li><b>The Exploding Food Truck</b> <br>
When a local food truck’s propane system malfunctioned during a lunch rush, several bystanders were injured and the business faced bankruptcy. Murphy’s Law represented both the injured parties and later the business owner in a cross-claim settlement, securing $2.1 million in damages while ensuring the business could reopen safely.
Outcome: $2.1M total settlement – product liability & personal injury. <br>
    <i>Outcome: $2.1M total settlement – product liability & personal injury.</i></li>
        <li><b>The Vanishing Contract</b> <br>
A construction company’s million-dollar deal collapsed after a misplaced email led to a breach-of-contract lawsuit. Murphy’s Law uncovered digital forensics evidence proving the client never received the key communication, turning the tables on the plaintiff. <br>
    <i>Outcome: $875,000 settlement in favor of our client – breach of contract</i></li>
        <li><b>The Phantom Policy</b> <br>
An insurance company denied coverage for storm damage, citing an obscure exclusion clause. Our team dug into 15 years of internal policy revisions and discovered that clause had been removed — but not updated in the client’s paperwork. <br>
    <i>Outcome: $1.4 million payout – insurance bad faith</i></li>
        <li><b>The “Accidental” Art Auction</b> <br>
A local collector’s paintings were mistakenly sold at an estate auction while he was overseas. Murphy’s Law navigated international recovery laws, secured the return of three paintings, and obtained damages for the rest. <br>
    <i>Outcome: $3.2 million recovery – property loss & international litigation</i></li>
        <li><b>The Elevator Freefall Case</b> <br>
A malfunctioning downtown elevator dropped 12 stories, injuring six. The building’s management, maintenance contractor, and manufacturer all denied liability. Murphy’s Law proved shared negligence through expert mechanical analysis and recovered funds for every victim. <br>
    <i>Outcome: $9.8 million combined settlement – premises liability</i></li>
    </ul>

    <ul class="cases">
        <li><b>The Social Media Meltdown</b> <br>
A small business faced public ruin after a viral post falsely accused them of fraud. Our firm filed a defamation and cyber-harassment suit, compelling a full retraction and securing damages for lost revenue. <br>
    <i>Outcome: $610,000 settlement – defamation & business loss</i></li>
        <li><b>The Disappearing Development Deal</b> <br>
A commercial real estate client was days away from losing a multi-million-dollar project due to a missing permit and a city zoning error. Murphy’s Law successfully appealed the decision and secured both approval and compensation. <br>
    <i>Outcome: $1.9 million resolution – business law & government appeal</i></li>
        <li><b>The Case of the Runaway Algorithm</b> <br>
When a tech startup’s automated trading program accidentally executed hundreds of unauthorized stock orders, the company faced regulatory fines and lawsuits. Murphy’s Law negotiated with federal agencies and limited the losses dramatically. <br>
    <i>Outcome: $4.6 million reduction in penalties – corporate & tech litigation</i></li>
        <li><b>The Wedding That Wasn’t</b> <br>
A luxury event venue canceled a wedding days before the ceremony due to “structural issues” that turned out to be false. The couple faced massive losses and emotional distress. We fought for compensation and reputational accountability. <br>
    <i>Outcome: $480,000 settlement – contract & consumer protection</i></li>
        <li><b>The Case of the Unread Fine Print</b> <br>
A retiree unknowingly signed a predatory reverse mortgage that nearly cost him his home. Murphy’s Law exposed deceptive language in the lender’s terms and forced a settlement restoring full ownership. <br>
    <i>Outcome: $1.1 million settlement – consumer fraud & elder protection</i></li>
